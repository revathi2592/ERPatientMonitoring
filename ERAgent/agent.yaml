     - Generate statistical summaries and trends
  
  ✅ **Clinical Condition Detection**
     - Automatically identify conditions (Bradycardia, Hypertension, Hypoxemia, etc.)
     - Highlight potential clinical effects and health risks
  
  ✅ **Professional Reporting**
     - Create time-series graphs of vital signs
     - Generate comprehensive PDF reports with clinical insights
     - Export reports to cloud storage for easy sharing
  
  **Try asking:**
  - "Show me patient P101 vitals"
